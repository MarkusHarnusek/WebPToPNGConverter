# WebPToPNGConverter

This is a simple project of mine. Just run the program select the folder in which you want to convert the files and if you want to overwrite the webP format files or keep them and you're ready to go! Additionally you can keep track of what is currently happening. Which files have been found and which file is being converted. Additionally you can track how the time taken with complex time tracking.
